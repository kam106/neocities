<p>Hey! Turn off your content blocker if a WinAmp window didn't pop up. Also, maybe move it out of the way while you read this text.</p>
<p>Okay, so I put in front of you a web recreation of WinAmp. That might be a little nerdy of me, but this is also a cool way to listen to the music and read about it! So play with the player in front of you as much as you want, and while you listen, below is information for every release you see right now. I tried to put everything in order, sorry if it isn't.</p>
<p>What you're about to hear is a collection of demos I have decided to publically release, completely free. I plan to also the stuff I already release on Tumblr, however that will take time.</p>
<p>Also, this site is intended for Desktop. Mobile will have a very bad time using this page, <b>especially if in portrait mode</b>.</p>

     <h3>Serenity</h3>
 <b>Original Name: </b>N/A
 <br><b>Created:</b> 09/05/2024
 <br><b>For: </b>True To Me (upcoming solo album)
 <br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>TBA
 <br><b>About:</b> Second officially released demo of Serenity
 <p>With the ongoing project True To Me continuing to be in development, and with the new release of this blog, I have chosen to release an updated version of Serenity from my Tumblr page, right here to promote this blog as well as update the progress as show in the Tumblr version. Here you go, people. Progress I made.</p>
 <p>Mixing is rough in the current state. Hopefully it is not complete shit, and it might just be listenable.</p><br><br>
 
    <h3>Enforced Transit (Initial Demo)</h3>
 <b>Original Name: </b>decay intro
 <br><b>Created:</b> 09/04/2023
 <br><b>For: </b>Now Entering Vezaa (september version of "Where Tyrants Fall")
 <br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>Unsure
 <br><b>About: </b> First version of "Enforced Transit", from before NEV was named
 <p>Enforced Transit was created as the introduction to the NEV project, which eventually became Where Tyrants Fall in 2024. It was just a simple project, and it started like this. I cannot remember if it made it to Where Tyrants Fall, or it's twin project The Cold Freeze Theory, but what I do know is the date of creation and some of the ongoing things in my life when this was made, which is not as important. Overall, Enforced Transit was just not used because I opted to work with different material.</p>
 <p>Additional fun fact: NEV was made with Nova.</p><br><br>
 
 <h3>"Trance"</h3>
 <b>Original Name: </b>N/A
 <br><b>Created:</b> September 2022
 <br><b>For: </b>Luck is Gambling: You're Outnumbered
 <br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
 <br><b>About:</b> Unused throwaway from the late LIG: YO era.
 <p>I do not have the exact date of creation for this demo, but what I am very confident about is that this was made in 2022 for Luck is Gambling, and this song is relatively undocumented like a lot of the rare material I have. And as all early material goes, it's... Something.<br>
 Say what you want about Nova being slow to release, but I have a lot of throwaways too, and sometimes those throwaways are not made to be for the final cut.</p><br><br>
 
 <h3>LIGYO2</h3>
 <b>Original Name: </b>N/A
 <br><b>Created:</b> September 2022
 <br><b>For: </b>Luck is Gambling: You're Outnumbered
 <br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
 <br><b>About:</b> Unreleased demo
 <p>The name is completely made up, because unlike Trance, there is no actual filename I can give this demo. Therefore, it's just LIGYO2, or if you're going off original filenames, "unmastered.mp3". This demo tries to be a production extraordinare for some reason, and I'll let you decide if that worked.<br>
 Also, my bad for fucking up the bounce. I forgot to properly fix it when exporting.</p>
