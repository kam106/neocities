      <h1>After Hours with Kam</h1>
      
      <p>Hi, welcome to After Hours! This is my personal blog where I document cool things I can remember and some journeys of mine on the internet. I mostly document my life here and where things have gone, but sometimes I'll also ramble about a cool topic I'm passionate about!</p>
      <p>Some of these posts are archives, so keep that in mind! I'll have the source listed if I'm backporting a topic.<br>I hope you have a good time!</p>
      <p>Alt text heavy blog, by the way! Some links have alt text, so hover over links for context!</p>
      <p><a href="https://punkto.org/zonerender?https://kam106.neocities.org/blog/archive">Copy this link and add it to your RSS feed!</a> I had to use <a href="https://punkto.org/blog/generating_zonelet_rss_feeds">Zonerender</a> to make the link possible, but I think RSS is something everybody should try, so here you go!</p>
