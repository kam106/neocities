      <p>Last I checked, I don't think my controller has gyro aim or anything, so this post is exclusively ranting about Stick Aim. Just clarifying.</p>
      <p>Stick aim makes me feel like I'm a god damn caveman. You ever just miss shots for no reason trying to find that enemy? You move too fast or too slow to catch up? It sucks. Yet I prefer movement and crouching on controller compared to keyboard and mouse. So it's like a complete priority shift... Kinda.</p>
      <p>It's like... Good god, isn't there a good in-between? Keyboard and Mouse works, yeah, but theoretically, is there at LEAST a good solution? Something cooler?</p>
      <p>Not really. I get the limitations, and most of the time it's fine, but Stick aim is just so unpolished, because of the lack of precision and it's just... ughhhh.</p>
      <p>Controller gaming just really sucks for shooters.</p>
