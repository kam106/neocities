<p>There are a lot of jokes in Things to Do When Bored, some are personal but a lot are just one off jokes that need to be explained, so that's what this post is for.</p>
<details>
<summary>Spoilers for the post!</summary>
"Rewrite an old joke you lost the script to" - This has a couple of meanings.<br>1. The idea of the blog post comes from a joke I cannot find anymore. If I was to try and find the original source, I would have to search through thousands upon thousands of files to read old chat archives. The script is literally lost.<br>2. Later on, this joke is rewritten. It was "lost" in the list of jokes.<p></p><p>"Tell Kam "Why did you make this"" - The original version of this line is repeated later on. Also, it adds to the below.<br><br>"Tell Kam "Why did you make this again"" - Following 'Rewrite an old joke', this is the second time this was ever done. Also adds to the below.<br><br>"Tell Kam that one day they will experience Karma for telling bad jokes" - All jokes in this blog are bad. Insert "Fuck you" here.</p><p>"Tell a repetition joke" - This blog features many jokes that involve telling it several times with only slight changes. Hence, it's a repetition joke. Tell a repetition joke.</p><p>"Use a Volcano as a Trash Can" - The original version of this joke involves potty humor, so this is a rewrite. <br>What if you could burn your trash?</p><p>"Make up a fact about an object that doesn't exist" - This is one of few jokes that don't have a joke attached to them. Interpret it however you'd like.</p><p>"Listen to Ryan Willen" - You remember how much I like Ryan Willen, right?</p><p>"Tell the same joke 3 paces later" - This joke also has several layers.<br>1. This was already told to somebody else prior to writing this blog. This is meta, but it counts.<br>2. The "Listen to" joke is told exactly 3 jokes later. The "kam106" and "wait a minute" joke can both be considered 3 paces later, although this was unintentional math on my part.<br>3. Some jokes are repeated 3 jokes later, way later on.</p><p>"Break up a good repetition joke with a very boring joke" - This can be interpreted as "The last joke breaks up the Listen to joke" or "This breaks up a good joke".</p><p>"Listen to kam106" - One of the two possible "three paces later" joke. Also, I wonder who that is.</p><p>"Listen to- wait a minute!" - The intended delivery for the "three paces later" joke. The person realizes they're 3 paces in.</p><p>"Tell the same joke 4 paces- wait a minute!" - This adds to the three paces joke, with another instance of the same joke. We have now told the same joke 3 AND 4 paces ahead.</p><p>"Say "Wait a minute" when nobody starts laughing" - Extension of above, the "wait a minute" joke has happened 3 lines in a row.</p><p>"Fool your friends three times" - Fool your friends three times in a row. The joke below explains this one.</p><p>"Fool your friends three times" - The above assumes your friend was fooled once. By making them read the same thing twice, you fooled them a second time. Adds to below.<br></p><p>"Fool your friends twice" - You changed it up, fooling them a third time. They think they were only fooled twice, but don't listen to them.</p><p>"Get in a situation where you have to explain the joke above" - When I told this joke to LS, it was explained to them. Therefore, I got in a situation where it had to be explained.</p><p>"Invent a method to fire a gun's barrel like a bullet" - This is a reference to a deranged idea I came up with, where clicking the trigger once on a made up pistol once fires a bullet, and clicking the trigger twice shoots the barrel.<br><br>"Oversimplification: The blog post is about a bunch of things you should probably not do" - This is explained near the end.<br><br>"Use a satire blog as a secret way to bottle up your feelings and subtly tell people you're too afraid to speak your mind" - This line is satire in itself. This did not happen.</p><p>"Look at spectrograms for fun" - Repetition joke for below.<br></p><p>"Look at cover art for fun" - Repetition joke for below.</p><p>"Look at the state of your brain that's forgetting what joke you were just thinking of (LOL!)" - Third part for the joke was forgotten.</p><p>"Tell a &lt;head&gt; joke" - Setup for the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke.</p><p>"Tell a &lt;body&gt; joke" - Setup for the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke.</p><p>"Combine the &lt;head&gt; joke and the &lt;body&gt; joke" - Create the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke so it can be told.</p><p>"Completely miss the &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; joke" - The joke fell under confused ears.</p><p>"Write the worst satire blog ever made" - Guess what you just read.</p><p>"Get SpaceHey famous" - This is based on a real thing where my friend Sky supposedly made me "SpaceHey famous". It's a nice nod to that.</p><p>"Make unnecessary references to your life situations" - References above, as well as the "Rewrite an old joke" line.</p><p>"Rip your newest blog idea from the SCP Wiki" - This joke is a satire of the original "The Things Dr. Bright Is Not Allowed To Do" list. Well, formatted in that way.<br></p><p>"Replace one of your OCs with a nearly identical clone with a different name and face and pretend that OC had controversy" - Playing on the above, an OC being replaced because of controversy. Like Dr. Bright and Dr. Shaw.</p><p>"Accidentally discover a real scenario of the above" - Dr. Bright being replaced.</p><p>"Have a nightmare about houses" - Satire joke that adds to the "Unnecessary references" joke in a very satirical way.</p><p>"Make people play two truths one lie with a satire blog post" - Adding to the above, make people guess what's right and what's wrong.</p><p>"Obsess over satire blog posts" - The entire post was satire. Obsession over satire blogs here.</p><p>"Reformat an older joke you forgot how it went" - This adds to the opening joke, which was reformatted because the script was "lost" in the sea of other jokes.<br></p><p>"Oversimplify a bunch of jokes" - An earlier line oversimplified the blog topic.</p><p>"Successfully concern one of your fans with an accidental thought leak" - Direct hit at Kanye West specifically.</p><p>"Successfully concern one of your friends with an accidental blog leak" - Blog post was accidently leaked when I took a screenshot, somebody said they were concerned about what the blog was about. Accidental blog leak concerned somebody.</p><p>"Create over 40 unfunny jokes" - Up to this point, there was 43 lines. Over 40 jokes.</p><p>"Tell Kam "this is awful why did you make this"" - Repeated joke from the beginning. A repetition joke.<br></p></details><p></p>
