      <p>Windows computers are quite possibly the most confusing and most magical thing to ever exist. No, this doesn't cover windows modifications, or technical depth. Just how I saw it.</p>
      <p>This entry is more so about my own experiences. The good, the bad, and the downright confusing. Now keep in mind, I've used technology since I was maybe 5. So I have both some stories on crazy, awesome things Windows has done, some really broken things that happened, and some confusing things it's done, as well as some bonus stories from my childhood related to technology. Yep, a full length blog again. Let's go.</p>
      <p>Let's start with some good Windows has done. Build some character, to make the smashdown a little more exciting. Well, to start, backwards compatibility is sometimes like good. Like REALLY good, obviously issues but most of the time it's flawless. At the most, I've had issues with certain GameHouse (remember that old game website? Where you used to buy Plants vs Zombies, maybe?) titles, at the worst. Though sometimes the issues aren't as bad, like simply just having some flippy fullscreen on Halo: Combat Evolved. Although there's definitely way worse, like folder detection with some games, but note how compatibility is mostly preserved!</p>
      <p>Other than Compatiblity, there's also, at least in my opinion, how older versions of Windows handled logging in. Windows 8 & 8.1 (2012 & 2014 respectively) and after has a kind of funky user change system, and I'm not a fan of it. Although at Windows 7 (2009), it was pretty smooth, and I really liked how it used to be. </p>

      <p>If you're unfamiliar, or you just never got to experience a computer before, it looked about like this:</p>
      <p>Yeah, there was that nice blue background, and all of the users were displayed in columns. You'd click one, enter your password if you wanted, and you'd be on your way. On Windows 8 and after, you see the first user, and you have to manually switch to another user in the login menu, which I don't like. And my device actually automatically logs into the correct user, which I'm not complaining, cause I don't use the other user on it, lol. Still though, imagine that happening to somebody else's account. Pretty annoying.</p>
      <p>But Windows 7 had this simple design. And it looked pretty nice. Vista (2007)'s was near the same, just with a green and blue gradient instead.</p>

      <p>I cannot for the life of me, cannot find a good screenshot, so instead here's one of Windows XP, released around 2001:</p>
      <p>Looks nice, don't it? If only Windows 8 and later was as simple as that. It would have been a nice thing to have, to be able to enjoy a more legacy login screen. Instead we have modern looking junk, and I think everybody knows what the Windows 10 login screen looks like.</p>

      <p>There's also a variant for nerds! Here's what that looks like:</p>
      <p>Alright, let's talk about the bad now. I think Performance is a good first thing to put on the table here, because I have a LOOOOOOOOOT to talk about when it comes to performance.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the lack of care. Windows 10 and beyond were designed for SSDs, it's clear it is if you've ever run windows on an HDD, like I am right now, you can just TELL how bad it is. Like you can FEEL how painful it is if you used one before. The constant pausing, the constant crashing of the file explorer, the consistent input lag, etc... You really begin to despite the OS. Even more when your manufacturer thinks it's fucking genius to put an HDD and Windows 10 64-bit together. Yeah.</p>
      <p>Oh, I'm not done. Obviously not. Would you like to talk about the fact that a bug with memory cleaning STILL exists in Windows 11? Yes, I'm fucking serious, In Windows 10, there is a bug where the memory doesn't clean itself. It causes stuttering in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins, Battlefield 1, and it affects both Intel and AMD CPUs. No seriously, there's reddit posts from like 4 years ago (2018 and before) about this shit. It's stupid. </p>
      <p>On top of THAT, it's also a NIGHTMARE to work with other software sometimes. A program I use for controlling CPU/GPU fan speeds and clock literally DOESN'T EVEN WORK. If I reinstall windows without using the "Reset this PC" function, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I try to uninstall it and entirely re-install it, IT CANNOT BE PROPERLY INSTALLED AGAIN. If I completely format my hard drive? You guessed it, CANNOT be properly installed again.</p>
      <p>Like this is a joke. It can't even update without erroring out all the time. Asus has the WORST OEM software I have ever used for a program, and I used to have an HP Laptop. I also used to literally run games that barely met the MINIMUM specs on a Compaq Scenario from 2007. And a 2020 laptop can barely last 5 minutes in the OS. Like???</p>
      <p>Although, the confusing is very short. Sometimes, the OS can magically repair itself. For example, explorer took 10 straight minutes to start after uninstalling a Windows 11 update. Starting the computer the next day, and it's the regular speeds. Sometimes it'd co-operate it, other times it'd randomly lock up random apps whenever it wants. Performance hacks that worked one day, might not another, then suddenly work again the third day. Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera.</p>
      <p>Yeah, Windows is kind of a wild one. But why not end it off with a story?</p>
      <p>I used to be pretty crazy of a computer user when I was young. I had once come across this thing, basically a YouTube video of about several shitty bat files you could make and you could call yourself a hacker for knowing how to make them or something. Well, one made about a thousand folders, and named them by numbers. I thought that was funny, so I did it on the desktop, and hid each one in a folder. So you'd go to one folder, you'd see 7, go to another, see 4, go to another, only see 2, etc. My parents didn't like that too much, but I thought it was cool. They were probably mad about it, but it was worth it for the laugh LOL.</p>
      <p>Until next post.</p><br>
      <p>Edit: Would you look at that, Windows forcing 100% of my CPU to be used at all times! I don't remember setting that, I sure wonder what's going on...
More proof Windows does what it wants! Spooky...</p>
