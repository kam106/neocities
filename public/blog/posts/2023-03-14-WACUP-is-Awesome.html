      <p>I was catching up on some SpaceHey just seeing what good stuff there was to read. I sometimes tend to do that, because I like reading dumb shit when I feel like it. In <strike>Athen</strike> Kam fashion, I ended up finding a rant about Winamp. Apparently they got into the Crypto scene, and it looked pretty ugly. Of course, I'm not a big fan of crypto stuff, so I decided "I guess that's another program gone".</p>
      <p>Well, I read through it, couldn't believe the bullshit about Winamp (which as of writing this, I'm uninstalling rn), and I noticed the guy actually linked this replacement called WACUP. It ran on a pretty stable build of WinAmp, added a lot of content, and expanded on it in a better way. I figured I'd give it a shot. If it was shit, well it's better than nothing. If it was good, I'd main it. Well, I downloaded it and decided to see what it was made of.</p>
      <p>God damn, it was fun installing it when I got the time.</p>
      <p>First off, the amount of extra features compared to the build I had previously (and now regret) installing, was kind of amazing. Already at the "check the features you want" phase, I was just trying to process what everything did. It felt way bigger than any other build of WinAmp, and it was almost like a new product. Credits to the WACUP team for all that shit they managed to cram in there, anyway.</p>
      <p>Installed it, and still pretty amazed. I can't tell if they did changes to the setup portion, but if they did they did it alright. Had fun picking out a theme and stuff. Setting everything up was as fun, I was playing with the Discord presence thing for the past 10 minutes, it was fun. Had to manually reinstall the Last.fm scrobbler plugin, but that wasn't too hard.</p>
      <p>I'm playing with it right now. All the themes and plugins they've slammed into this thing is kind of funny. I could mess with this thing for a few hours. But hey, it works exactly for what I needed Winamp and Foobar2000 for: A music player that has Discord Rich Presence and scrobbles to Last FM.</p>
