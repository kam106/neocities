      <p>So, it appears we have reached the point where ROBLOX has completely lost it's ways. The events ROBLOX is choosing to push out now all follow the same pattern, have almost no originality, and are complete dogshit.</p>
      <p>Really, this is the fourth event in a ROW to start with the word "The", be made in the "Stock Owners First" era, and the fourth in a row to earn a blog post from yours truly complaining about it. if you can accomplish this over four times in a row, you're clearly just sticking with making dogshit for the shock value. There is no other explanation why this event should suck any more than it is.</p>
      <p>But no, here we are. Roblox is making dookie events again, and I guess it's because they're bored? I don't fucking know. They do this every major season and it seems to just get worse and worse than the last. The event is now centered around halloween, following the last event being about empires. Keep in mind that the first entry in this event started as a ""easter"" event. Yes, the double quotes TWICE is necessary, because there was hardly any easter theming in the event. Then we got The Classic, while charming and had some history right, mostly appealed to the morons who wanted to be ""nostalgic"". Then we got The Games, an absolutely hilariously named event with even more hilariously attempted tasks, which just once again served to ruin the experience.</p>
      <p>And well, here we are. Fourth fucking time in a row we have to do this stupid shit. Do they not get bored of this already? Is there not already enough people screaming from below begging ROBLOX to stop releasing shitty events? Well, I guess they can't hear us, because they dropped another turd from above. I guess we have to get our hands dirty again.</p>
      <h1>Problems, Problems and Money Making</h1>
      <p>This event was doomed to be dogshit from the start. About twenty minutes away from the event starting, servers restarted. I'm going to be completely real, there were people guessing there was nothing behind the door in the first place and I think they're right. We were waiting there for minutes on end just hoping in vein something interesting happens. What else do you do with the fucking mental asylum looking manor design? It reminds me of another particular game I know of. But maybe it's best I keep my mouth shut.</p>
      <p>This event is just dogshit. They restarted once for shits and giggles, twice to award people the join badge. They must have been really bored waiting for problems to fix and finally had to get off their ass last minute to add something behind the event front doors. What, were they afraid that exploiters would check behind the map before they did anything? Then fix the fucking exploits! Maybe then there wouldn't be anything to worry about!</p>
      <p>That isn't even the worst part. I guess they also wanted us players to suffer on their behalf, because the event is only a week long, give and take some hours. I guess they really didn't learn from The Classic? The Hunt was a month long. The Classic was only 5 days, but The Games was about three weeks. Now they're back to one week, because I guess they like forcing time crunches on people. Fucking hell.</p>
      <p>It's clear they don't give a shit about you too, because when you get to the center room where all the important things take place, there's a headless horseman playing piano. Guess what that is! It's called a fucking upsell. They're trying to sell you a 31k bundle this year, let alone the fact it's like four hundred dollars. Go suck off your parents kids, or you can't be cool like us! Like all the bundle does is remove your head, why would you want that shit so desperately? That doesn't need to be in the lobby, get out of here!</p>
      <h1>Conflicting Interests</h1>
      <p>You want to know what I think about the game selection this year? It's as bad as The Games.</p>
      <p>It was really bad during The Games. There were many conflictions, such as Dress To Impress and Fashion Famous, Funky Friday and RoBeats. Not to mention by that point, Adopt Me had made it into three events in a row. Interesting.</p>
      <p>Well, I guess The Haunt took that and cranked it up to about eleven. Because not only has Adopt Me, the least scariest game imaginable has made it to a fourth event, but there's even MORE conflictions! Get this: Pressure and Doors. That's a combo you weren't expecting, huh? Not to mention we again have Dress to Impress.</p>
      <p>It doesn't even end there, they got ROYALE HIGH to participate. I don't know if you're aware, but Royale High is supposed to be about getting grades up, trading tails and looking sharp, not about dodging the known horrors of society. It's actually fucking impressive what kind of ways they fucked up this year.</p>
      <p>Okay, sure, theoretically you could make a monster in Royale High, but it's not as effective as a REAL horror game, which is something that is of note. you know what else isn't a "real horror game"? SLAP BATTLES. The choices the developers have made when picking out games this year is borderline impressive and it still gives me shock how little they tried.</p>
      <h1>Straying from Familiarity</h1>
      <p>You know how events are supposed to go, right? You join games participating, do tasks, get items. That's how it's been for the past three events, and how it's been... since forever.</p>
      <p>Okay, now guess how you get items in The Haunt.</p>
      <p>That's right, taking screenshots, sending them to let others vote, and letting people vote on them to see what gets the most upvotes! You fucking dumbasses didn't think it was something else, right?!</p>
      <p>Yes, that is what they're doing now. Now you have to explore the game lobby to find things, and how do you explore the lobby? Wait for shit to open up! Fucking genius, right? And this opens random bums up to send inappropiate screenshots, or even downright awful screenshots. In fact, it's ENCOURAGED because you can get certain items, BY UPLOADING SCREENSHOTS. That is the event. I have explained the entire event, in about a few sentences. Event's over, you can go home now.</p>
      <p>It's actually impressive. Half of the time you can get a vote but they're all garbage, one being a random ass screenshot of a dude flexing his pets, one of a guy running from a nextbot, one of somebody's ROYALE HIGH OUTFIT, and another that you can't even comprehensibly explain by adding more than "it's offtopic". Holy shit.</p>
      <p>And in the end, you get your items, right? Guess what day one's item is.</p>
      <P>an RHTRO item. This is a fucking joke.</P>
      <p>And you want to know the crazy part? Not even VOTING worked on day one. The VOTING. Think about that.</p>
      <Hr>
      <p>Pop quiz, what's the one thing that should be kept in mind when making an interface?<br>If you said anything that isn't "usability", you're just as bad as a ROBLOX event developer.</p>
      <p>And that isn't no fucking hyperbole, The Haunt has the worst UI design I've seen so far. But who the fuck cares about that, right?</p>
      <p>Clearly they still don't care now, because four events later, there is STILL a gold track. So on top of all the technical issues, on top of the confusing changes, on top of having to WAIT for areas to open up, on top of the bad UI designs and the confusing game choices and every other flaw that has plagued this event series since FEBURARY, we have still not thought that we have made enough money to quit the GOLD TRACK.</p>
      <p>And I have to end the blog there. Because there's literally ZERO game objectives to talk about. I cannot expand the blog any more because they decided voting on screenshots was a better user experience than the shit from the past few events. THIS was their solution to fixing the bad game choice? Instead of actually getting competent developers to run the event instead of cash grabs, they just stop them from doing ANYTHING fun. This is like when the preschooler teacher takes everybody's recess time because one guy misbehaves. And in turn, you can't have a funny blog shitting on the flaws of this event.</p>
      <p>It is fucking IMPRESSIVE how lazy they are. Anything but a proper fucking event, right! ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING FUCKING LIKABLE. They like to reuse the same animations, the same frames, the same fucking ideas and the only thing they change up is the ONE thing that should not have been changed.</p>
      <p>They don't even give you a reason to play. I'm sure as hell not playing this.</p>
