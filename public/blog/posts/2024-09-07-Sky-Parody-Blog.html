<p><small>a parody of <a href="https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=1252078" target="_self">sky's blog post</a> about the honeydew resort coffee, but it's all wrong<br></small></p><h1>Backstory</h1><div>Woah, I broke my blog streak!!!<br><small>"kameron!" i hear you say, "copying sky's line near one for one and just mocking it isn't funny and is just cyberbullying!". well, fuck you, i don't have a better opener!<br></small></div><div><br></div><div>Sounds like my therapist is calling me for another music demo! But before I can go do that, I need to go check out this new recipe this boy in a bandanna showed me! I'm always up for a nice nutritional snack anyway. I normally make myself a nice bowl of Tem Flakes and a side of "Ripping Off the Poor", but it looks like life is telling me both that I need to do something original instead of copying Sky, and that a few therapists in my area will be able to fix my god damn personality. But instead of shilling money to a person who can fix my problems, let's pretend they don't exist and snack a little at a few scambait videos together!<br><small>fuck did i just imagine noelle on my desk, telling me this is also cyberbullying? OH FUCK THAT'S THE SWAT TEAM OUTSIDE MY D</small><br></div><p>I was thinking about this fan extension, Epilogue, and... threw that idea out of the window when I remembered that the twice no good asshole fornnox was recently outed at the millionth weirdo making Undertale fangames, because those definitely exist. Now normally, I would say that you should seperate art for the artist, or that if you think that Fornnox is a real username that you're a loser, but this time it's time to take things seriously. So instead, we're opting for a simpler recipe! I considered the Honeydew resort items, but if I had to be fair... Copying from Shayy again is a dumb idea, and probably a copyright infringement. Plus, Sky already did the coffee.<br><br>I considered instead briefly that maybe this blog should be about the scarves instead, maybe we can knit something nice looking and we can maybe... Have some fun. And we can have a nice, relaxed blog for once about clothing and design choi-<br><br>JUST KIDDING, FUCK FASHION! Today, I remembered about the existance of Gunpowder, and we're going to make it today!</p><p>Now normally, there would be a way to buy this item, and lo and behold, there is! If you head over to Blackjack's shop, you can actually buy this thing. Unfortunately I'm now banned from every major screenshot company which I'll get to in a second. But what we can assume is that this item can be bought, and nobody knows how to supervise a child. Great!<br></p><p>And normally, I would have a description or even a hint on what this item does, some of the secret ways to get this item coming in 2.0 or something. But unfortunately, not only may I have forgotten to do proper research for this blog post (adhd), but Master Sword keeps DMCA'ing <i>all my god damn</i> screenshots. Fine, we can work with a text only blog, just like everybody else. No in-game screenshots, no eye candy, no fucking NOTHING. This is MY blog, not nobody elses, and I'll do this my way.</p><p><small>Hey, what kind of fangame name is Epilogue-</small><br></p><p>Okay, so what do we know about the Gunpowder? Well, it's apparently so bad you choke to death. That's about all I can think of. It's also jokingly referred to as the "forbidden spice"...</p><p>I can't fucking work with this. This isn't enough flavor text to get a recipe... Hm. Well, we need to get a recipe made. So I guess little ol' me will have to do. Let's assume that this is not in fact gunpowder, and is just some strange spice. Okay, I think I know how to do this. It looks like we will need:<br></p><ul><li>Red Food Coloring</li><li>Minature Rocks<br></li><li>Blue Food Coloring</li><li>Green Food Coloring</li><li>Table Salt</li><li>Yellow Food Coloring</li><li>Preservatives</li><li>Spare Change from under the cushions<br></li><li>A Hint of Baby Powder</li><li>Legally Obtained Cocaine</li><li>Gunpowder</li></ul><p>...I can't work with this. this is already ridiculous. I mean come on, baby powder? What the fuck was I thinking writing this last night? Okay, well surely there's a gun shop down the road and-</p><div>No, I can't work with this. A shitty photoshopped gag is not enough. Nothing is. How do you make a good joke out of eating gunpowder? We're not 12 with a cowboy hat. This isn't exactly an AU Tumblr Blog either...</div><div><br></div><div>Fuck it, let's just try this to taste.</div><div><br></div><div>...</div><div><br></div><div>...This shit is gross. I can still feel it in my MOUTH.</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, how the fuck do you get a child to just CASUALLY eat this?! It is already an impressive job that UTY has not been sued by CPS for encouraging the consumption of Gunpowder for fucks sake, but nobody to supervise a child for trying to eat this shit? You have to die to try something as dumb as this.</div><div><br></div><div>Not to mention we need to start looking logically. How the fuck do you regain health by eating gunpowder? Where is the logic?<br><small>Kameron, this is a video game! It's not meant to have-</small></div><div><br></div><div>Shut the fuck up.</div><div>Blog over.</div><div><small>You cannot be serious.</small><br>I said blog over.<br></div>
