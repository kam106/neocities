      <h1>Do It To Death</h1>
      <p>Why, yes, I can hear it now! I can hear the screaming in the distance, the voices asking me to stop! I can hear them scream to me again, asking.<br>
    No, BEGGING me to stop squashing their golden system! And my response, my friend... I must say that I <small>do not give a single fuck what you think and think your bibilical angel needs to be burned!</small><br><br>
<small>Why are you booing me? I'm right!</small></p>
<h1>A Sinful Miracle</h1>
<p>What a completely broken down fucking piece of shit. <a href="https://kam106.neocities.org/blog/posts/2023-03-08-Technology-is-Like-Magic" title="A great post, but it has to be crapped on for today.">This is going to be no nice post about the sunflowers,</a> because oh boy, I am so fucking over that. There can only be so much sprinkes on a shit cake, and I've been done trying to say positive things about this OS for a very long time.</p>
<p>The way we have become glued to this piece of shit is just horrible. We're being forced to work with this dogshit because the entire computer market is nothing but putting the consumer on a leash. "Don't let that motherfucker move more than an inch, it might break a battery!". Fucking pathetic. You can wave your warrenty just by fucking breathing. Disable Secure Boot? No warrenty for you, little boy! Doesn't matter if it was a mistake you made fumbling the bios or on purpose to change your boot screen logo, it's gone FOREVER! Thanks a lot, UEFI. God.</p>
