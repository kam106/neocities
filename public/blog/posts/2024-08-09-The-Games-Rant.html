<h1>An Unexpected Collab</h1><p>Before I get into the main blog, I just want to clear this up.</p><p>For this blog, I have collaborated with fellow SpaceHey user&nbsp;<a href="https://spacehey.com/hkrk40k" target="_self">Nova</a> on this blog, as we worked together to investigate a good handful of games on this event. I wouldn't be able to cover as many bases as I did without their help, and it took a good few days to work with them on a project this large. We worked collaboratively across about 4 days, and we're glad to be able to show this to you today.l</p><p>Many thanks to them for a lot of the information here, I couldn't do any of this without your help!</p><h1>Sources</h1><p>* - one person provided surface level information on the game and the other dived right in to confirm it</p><p><br>A majority of my sources come from actually diving in blind in the Hub and finding games by random.&nbsp;<br>Though I still have some people that I used to source information and all that. First of all, I'd like to thank&nbsp;<a href="https://spacehey.com/lazt_ee" target="_self">Nova</a> for diving in blind with me, as well as providing some info on some games I ended up having no time to play.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/18320910606/The-Games" target="_self">It is highly recommended you dive in the game blind yourself to confirm a lot of what I said.</a> This is the only way you can reliably back up my sources, because let's be real, it's better to fact check yourself.</p><p>As Nova and I have both provided different information of the games on this event, and since we have chosen different games, I have labeled in the games part of the blog who played what game, so you know who provided the information.</p><p><br></p><p>That being said, let's start, at last.</p><h1>A Rocky Start (Intro)</h1><p>To say that ROBLOX's new events have been on a very unstable start is, in my personal opinion, an understatement. And is this event able to carry what the last event failed to do?&nbsp;</p><p>Not really.</p><h1>A Surprise Drop?</h1><p>On the afternoon of August 1st, I discovered that The Games dropped. I had no hype for this event, as by this point, it was all drained from me. As I waited for The Hunt, I was interested in it's sudden return, but by the end, I had no interest in the event at all.</p><p>It had already stung people a lot that The Hunt ended up not focusing on Easter, a holiday that was basically recent news when The Hunt dropped. It was really devastating to see this new corporate taste on the old "Egg Hunt" format we all knew. The "developer hunt" style of the previous Egg Hunts from as far back as 2019 already dissapointed players, and even viewed the developers as lazy, rather than make their own unique game special made for the egg hunt.</p><p>That was a completely different ladder step. Now there was a completely new low for egg hunts, and it was coming to town: A soulless mess devoid of any easter mention.</p><p>When The Classic came around, I hoped it would be better than the last. I had low hope, knowing how ROBLOX operates and it's long list of controversies the site has gathered, but I did end up trying to hold on. When The Classic came around, I played it, and posted a full blog about it. The short part of the story is that it just wasn't any better to me. It was too short, wasn't worth it, a myriad of other issues.</p><p>This time around? I expected it to be dogwater. I had no hope for this event, and rightfully so. The Hunt was a shit event. The Classic was an upgrade to nothing short of horrendous. And right on queue, The Games followed right behind, it's stench following. Where The Hunt overdid itself and bloated itself up MASSIVELY, and The Classic cut users off with a short event during the busiest time for students around, The Games was different in one regard.</p><p>This event did have one thing going for it, and that was diverting my expectations. I don't remember if the release date was announced, so maybe I was just tuned out. But basically, I was actually not counting down for it, it came to me out of nowhere. I was checking out a Michael's Zombies update, and then it kicked in:<br>Oh my god, the new event is out.<br><br>But the excitement quickly died down after one game. Well given, there was little excitement at all, but whatever of it had spawned had basically immediately died down by game two. And that's saying something as I tried to be optimistic for The Hunt and appreciative for The Classic. However, it has now occurred to me what kind of future we're having with events. And as I see it, it's unoriginal, copy pasted, and just underwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You wanna know what else is copy pasted? "The games" doing their part. It's always the three quest format, nobody tries anything ambitious, nobody tries the gladiator theme, nobody tries anything that stands out. It's just a bunch of people sporatically making something that grinds out Premium Payouts and that is it. Copy pasted, tedious events, that make you milk money to the highest bidder.</p><p>Or even better, the copy pasted names used to name these past three events!&nbsp;I mean come on, fucking "The Games"?! How do you design something so utterly, fucking, sh-</p><p><small>sorry to cut you off, past kam, but we have to move on now!</small></p><h1>Yet No Different</h1><p>And this event still manages to be like the other two events we've seen. If anything, it seemed to be worse. They clearly didn't write down how we enjoyed the little selection from The Classic, and went back to the million game selection they did in The Hunt. It's already pissing me off how only the FIRST prize from the event was non-Layered Clothing (excluding the wings, and maybe one other prize, most of it is layered clothing), a ROBLOX feature I have no use for. But the massive spike in game presence in this event came back to spite me, I guess. Long live being able to choose what you want to play when you can just overwhelm the user, right?</p><p>At least they provide more time than The Classic. More time as in like... I don't know, 3-5 more days. That's still like what, 10 days? It's a little better than the classic, but when you account for the game selection increase, they don't really do you much justice. Sure, it's better, and during the most free time of year, but keep in mind that there's about maybe 50 games, and only ~10 days to do it, give or take. But before we go on another ramble about time crunch, let's move on. The game selection.</p><p>The game selection is still shit. They tried to make up for it by adding actually good games like Michael's Zombies, RoBeats and Arsenal, but they still flopped by adding Adopt Me, more shovelware garbage, Survive the Killer and Tongue Battles of all games. I genuinely had to wipe my eyes for a moment, because I felt like I was seeing double considering the weird shit they pulled this event. Process this, they added stuff from the past two events, again. On top of that, they added a game about fighting with your TONGUE of all things, and on top of that, they added a bunch of games that do nothing but milk the money out of you. Was the goal to make money or to enlighten people?</p><p>Actually, let's talk MORE about the game selection while we're here, because it's just as nonsensical as The Classic. Dress to Impress and Fashion Famous at once? RoBeats and Funky Friday, two rhythm games based on completely different franchises? Better yet, how did Adopt Me make it to all three of these events? Let alone Michael's Zombies, which appears to be the only 13+ game on this list, which they sure weren't open to last time. Speaking of, how the fuck is Bad Business all ages? Somebody forgot about the gun UGC wipe. Fucking fantastic.</p><p>Oh don't even worry about games, we're not even DONE talking about them! Let's talk more about the fact the games still don't fucking try! There is still a huge issue in many games where the objective is not clearly labeled, many games still do not follow the theme, and better yet, most of the games are STILL pay to win grinding.</p><p>ROBLOX game events have been garbage this year. It's amazing this was approved at all. The gladiator esque theme is cool, but we all know no game is going to follow it. I mean, go talk to Guts and Gunpowder and see if they give a fuck. Go ask if Michael's Zombies will make a roman themed event. Nobody cares about the theme, they just want you to stay around them. It just adds onto the disappointment for this event that the theme was again ignored, let alone what kind of shit they were on when they made the teams. How the fuck were they named and made, again? Why is there a team named "Giant Feet"? Who are the kinds of people making these fucking teams? Why does Kreek have a dynamic head on, doesn't he NOT use one?</p><p>No, you can't make this shit up. This event takes the cake. I genuinely had to limit my range of games to make this review digestible. Both for your sanity and for mine. This shit is worthless. It is already hard to take seriously an event that announces in chat when you join "the built different team Giant Feet team". There is some serious problems with ROBLOX's moderation team. This have to be a nightmare for some kind of Internal team.</p><p>"This is where Legends are made" my ass. The only legend being made is the legend of the awful event series. Wait until somebody drops one all over this event and spray paints over it.</p><h1>Game Specific Stuff</h1><p>Okay, meta time for a second, I fucked this up on the last blog. I threw things at you at once, that wasn't fair. So let's do it right.</p><p>Every game will have it's own category to not bloat the other sections, as it should have been. We'll talk about each game one by one and split them up so they can have space. Now the review should be more digestible and can be enjoyed a little easier.</p><p>Since this is also a collaboration blog, I have included who played what games. Just so you know which one of us this is coming from.</p><p>Now let's go.</p><h2>Funky Friday (oh boy)</h2><p>[Information from kam106, played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>Funky Friday was so interesting, because it was the second game I played. We'll get to the first game in a minute, but first I need to absolutely RANT about this game for a moment.<br></p><p>The first quest is, for a rhythm game... An obby! Ah yes, a musical genre known for just jumping across burgers, donuts and pool floaties for ten minutes. This is definitely what I expect for this game, where the protagonist Blue Hair has to jump across floating objects to get to his girlfriend!&nbsp;</p><p>...That's probably a real thing in an alternative universe of our own, but maybe let's not think about that right now.</p><p>About the last two quests now. I'm not going to hide it, I am dogshit at Friday Night Funkin'. I was never active when the game gained popularity, and therefore, my skills for the game basically don't exist. Not only that, but I generally never cared for it, being more occupied with other projects of mine, such as my side music project. So, I never really played. I'd listen to a soundtrack or two, that was it. So when I found out this game was in the event, I generally hoped it would at least be easy. The first quest was simple enough, completing an obby in 10 minutes. All was left was to beat three levels and beat somebody's ass in 3 of 6 songs. After all, who would gatekeep event items based on skill, right?</p><p>...Right?</p><p>Oh boy, that was a fun thing to say to myself. Especially after finding out there was a score cap you had to reach before you could earn anything. I scored under that in two of three of the levels at once. But not only do they add this to the second quest, they added it to the third one! So you can forget about cheesing the fight. If you go one under the bar, that's no reward for you, bucko!</p><p>I don't know what it is, if I'm just severely under the skill cap, or my eyes need an adjustment, or if I genuinely need some kind of practice, because I was having a pretty bad time on this game. It was so bad in fact, this is the one game that made me account swap. Through this entire event. And it gave me so bad of a headache, I had to actually clear my mind WHILE I did this. So having that on my mind paired with this game? Yeah, that was not fun. At all.</p><p>Nova and I tackled it anyway and we just decided to be ourselves for the event. And after all, that was just one game. Surely the others won't be as terrible?</p><h2>Michael's Zombies</h2><p>[Information from kam106, played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>Okay, now THIS was the first game in the event I played. This game is both better and worse than Funky Friday in it's unique ways, but for the most part, it's an improvement!</p><p>First off, it involves a hub! Not a small thing to note, but a nice, welcome addition. It's well made and has some features that seamlessly integrate with gameplay, such as using it's tropical theming to make the biggest mechanic fit in with the theme. If you didn't understand what I just said: You can buy drinks from coolers. Review over.<br>Just kidding, let's talk more.</p><p>I wasn't a fan of the minigames present during this little event hub, but they were nice touches. There's a baseball field minigame, a minigame where you can grab your grandfather's Garand to go skeet shooting, and even a reskin of the map Lighthouse. I generally liked the Lighthouse bit of the map the most, running in with water guns you can buy at the Mystery Box, and going in with the perks you buy at the coolers to get a bunch of points. Maybe I just really like killing zombies.</p><p>Extending on the Lighthouse challenge, you can't go down and die immediately. So they definitely had a casual idea in mind, as going down just forces you back up with most of your perks removed. So at least you can't die and take forever to return to where you were. That's really nice, and better than the normal stressful modes where at a moment's notice you could lose it all.</p><p>The minigames are alright. I really liked the creative theming Michael's Zombies showed through this event, as well as using sport rackets for melee weapons as well as a baseball bat as a free melee. Another fresh addition is the themeing of perk colas as cooler sodas, as well as it's use of minigames and the overall theme of a tropical resort. Great refreshment from the stressful loop of shoot zombie, spend money.&nbsp;</p><p>Better than many games on this list, despite myself not favoring it.</p><h2>Arsenal</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova &amp; kam106]</p><p>I never liked Arsenal's The Classic event. In fact, I hated it. The Hunt had a better event, one I enjoyed way more. So going into Arsenal, I expected myself to absolutely hate this game's event. So, I went in for shits and giggles.</p><p>But I am short of impressed. Maybe it's the fact I hated The Classic's version of the event to my bone. It was so unclear. So I went in, giving the game another try. And you know what? That was a good choice.</p><p>I attempted my first try completely solo, which ended up being nothing short of a nightmare, as expected with running in blind. With the lack of backup on my side and having nobody to back me up when I make careless mistakes? It was obviously a terrible shot. I was tired as well, so I ended up giving it a second thought with Nova and we went in together for our second try (their first was with one of my friends, where both of them won it first try, I ended up quitting before finishing). And it was this run where we finally finished the questline. But I will say, just like The Hunt, this is one of the highlights of the event.</p><p>Arsenal takes a very interesting turn on the event, converting the game into a rogue kind of game (i don't know the term, please excuse my wording) with cards offering advantages, and your classic arsenal of weaponry being able to be bought at checkpoint shops, known as "The Blank Check". The environment feels like a casino, while not gladiator themed, it does feel like an arena at times, which does give it points for at least somewhat trying to add to the theme. Somehow.</p><p>I tried not to spoil much, but the game is a nice addition to this event and is a nice minigame I'd return to if I was really bored.</p><p>The quests, to give it credit, are actually fucking digestible. Kill 20 enemies in one go, beat the first floor without buying items, beat all 3 floors in one go. It's nice, to the point, and not a grind fest. Unlike some games on this list...</p><p>Generally, better than everything else featured here.</p><h2>Horrific Housing</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by kam106]</p><p>I'm sorry for the lack of words for this section of the review, as I genuinely had to stop playing within the first slideshow. I didn't even bother to complete the event on this game.</p><p>I already wish I could have enough attention span to finish this game, I really hoped it would motivate me to return to the game. No, they turn around and force you first thing to survive a flood, a RANDOMLY CHOSEN EVENT. WHO CHECKS THIS SHIT?! This event continues to find ways to amaze me and this is the biggest part of it so far. How the fuck do you do that? Locking event completion behind a random number generator event, let alone behind an event that possibly has it's odds rigged? It's a tasteless move.</p><p>Let alone from a game that last had it's prime in what, 2018? The nostalgia factor ended around 2020 in my case, and after 2020 there was literally no reason to return to this game. Watching the potential be thrown away for this game is just...</p><p>Fuck this, next game.</p><h2>Shrek Swamp Tycoon</h2><p>This game is just boring. For a game that piggybacks off of a popular franchise like Shrek, I refuse to believe somebody on the development forgot to add indication on your-</p><p>Wait sorry, wrong blog post.</p><h2>Sonic Speed Simulator</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova &amp; kam106, played by Nova]</p><p>Holy shit, this event finds new ways to disappoint. I knew this game would have completely flopped one way or another after seeing The Hunt force you to collect a hundred random collectibles with no real purpose or end goal, at least not clearly described. I found this part of The Hunt agonizing and forgettable. Waste of potential.</p><p>I guess this time they looked back on their past actions and thought, "Add over ten times as much for The Games". I already have a distaste for Gamefam's mistreatment of employees and their poor response to said allegations, seeing Sonic Speed Simulator proceed to make their questline as boring and stressful as possible. I'm seriously convinced their goal was not to make a fun event, but to maximize what they can get from the Premium Payouts. Fuck Gamefam.</p><p>The only benefit is that you can collect all of these things that look like Chaos Emeralds (nicknamed McGuffins, as seen on the last blog about The Hunt) on the first stage, Green Hill Zone. Other than that, this game is awfully executed with an average time of 15 minutes, possibly up to an hour to complete for those that are slower. On top of that, Gamefam's controversial history, bad treatment of employees and it's controversial history is not only a huge fuckup on ROBLOX's part, but also a horrible taste on this event.</p><p>...Hey wait a minute. What's that, you collected all thousand of your little McGuffins? BAM, two more right over your head! Get a perfect .1 frame time in one of our time trials and beat a metal sonic in a race! Yeah, thanks a lot for the jumpscare when I read TMNT, asshole. I thought you would have made me grinded like the other games.</p><p>Speaking of, how does the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fit into all of this? They're busy eating pizza and slowly morphing from sewer radiation, not joining Sonic in a friendly race. Or maybe I'm just missing the point, I don't know.</p><p>The name of the quests too... "Cowabunga" further playing on the TMNT collab. This is so fucking random. At least "Give It Your Best" kind of fits with the time trial quest. "Wanna Go Fast" is an unrelated name for the Thousand McGuffin Grind (trademark).<br></p><p>Moving on before I just get more frustrated.</p><h2>Epic Minigames</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova, played by kam106]*</p><p>Just like a line of games mass produced in a factory, Epic Minigames blends in the bland and low effort quests as seen in many other games in this event. Going from a Smurfs event in 2016 where they have a completely original minigame to complete for a prize, this game has lost all of it's originality and charm for a simple three mission questline that has NOTHING to do with the game's theme. While we're at it, let's just say the Gladiator theming is off the charts and the whole thing is freestyle. Yes, that will explain the dogshit decisions made throughout this entire event!</p><p>This is even more fun because Epic Minigames doesn't make it immediately clear that this is what you're supposed to do. All you know is that there's a bunch of shit on your screen and that this game is in the event. I had to deliberately search the menus to find out, oh shit, there's 3 missions on your screen in the bottom right, and THAT is what you have to do for the event! And there's an optional fourth if, surprise, you buy VIP! Gotta love gatekeeping and paying to win, right?</p><p>This isn't even all of it, because they also refresh the missions daily, making the whole thing an unnecessary power push. So, you have to dedicated a whole DAY to completing randomized tasks, in hopes that you get a three that you can do without buying their stupid subscription or something.</p><p>Again, this is putting your fate in the hands of a random number generator. This is borderline gatekeeping by skill if you look at it at the right angle. What kind of shit are people smoking when they make these events, when in the end, it's worse than the events that preceeded them?</p><p>And the whole big thing is you don't even know if ROBLOX enforced a bland event or if the developers just didn't try. It's left ENTIRELY up to interpretation. What a load of shit.</p><h2>RoBeats</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>Let's tackle the elephant in the room first with a nice, iron polished dagger:<br>Why is there two rhythm games in this event?</p><p>We already have Funky Friday, which was allegedly bought by Gamefam (flashback to the Sonic Speed Simulator part of the blog), and had several people through it's lifetime object to it's existance and additions, INCLUDING tweets made by Ninja Muffin. Oh, that's not enough? Throw in a guitar hero clone, that'll get them excited and fighting over their fangames.</p><p>Do you want to have more fun? Find three friends who will play three rounds of this game. And as far as I can guess, any three songs. Well, that will be hard, finding two other friends available to join you, you need a three person lobby. You could always play with strangers, but who knows if they have a score cap like Funky Friday did. You might have to beat everybody there for all anybody knows.</p><p>Okay, cool. We did that. What's next on the questline? Surprise, a three page list of tasks to complete for points! Get to 1k points total worth of tasks to get your damn reward.&nbsp;</p><p>It's math time, put on your nerd glasses. The only 500 point task requires you to do another 7 more songs (possibly another 10!) with those said 3 friends, from there you can complete 250 x 2. Your only other hope is to get 250 x 3 (3 max 250 point tasks) that requires the foremented 3 song thing to be done possibly another 3 times over, as well as winning a single match with 3+ people, and completing 10 songs of any difficulty, this time the player count not accounted for. It could be solo, or only with 10 people at once.</p><p>Okay, let's say we did the 250 x 3 route. That's 750 points, you did one half of the remaining two tasks. To do the other, you'll have to do the 200 quest which is getting a B rank on an "extended cut" song, whatever that is, that's 950. Now you can do any other task, like queueing a song on Robeat's radio for 50 points. There you go, 1k reached, you can finally leave this math mess. Take the nerd glasses off.</p><p>That was a lot of math for a game about rhythm. Thanks for the micro math lesson, let's not do it again. We're moving on before somebody starts complaining about the math.</p><h2>Pull a Sword</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>Pull a Sword... Oh, the distasteful adventures we had on The Hunt. I see you have come back with a harder hitting grind. One worse than the Pet Sim 99 grind. You're not special for that.</p><p>This game does a very funny. Funny, as in completely realistic depiction of David Bazooka being powerful and daunting, boasting what seems to be 100 billion strength. What a simulator type scenario for a simulator type shovelware game.</p><p>And holy shit, it should not take over fourty minutes to grind for this event, let alone 15 minutes of that being back to back. Why 40 minutes, you ask? Well, for 100 billion strength. It took almost 50 minutes to reach 200 billion to cheese the bossfight. Guess what was earned in the first 40. A measely 23 billion strength. Do the math, that's about two tenths of what you need, 2/10 for those who need it visualized. 2/10 of 100B, in 40 minutes.</p><p>I just can't put it any other way. It's actually mindblowing how this shit is laid out. And you have to earn about 200 billion strength to completely cheese the fight. Well shit, I didn't know I was getting screwed over that way too! We're just inventing new ways to inflict mental pain on the end user, are we? How about you do that by making a game addicting enough that it makes sense and DRAWS people to it's fairness, not so painful that you wish you blew your brains out in five minutes.</p><p>Oh but that's just the FINAL quest. First, they make you do an obby, basically ripping Funky Friday's concept right out of their hands and slamming it onto their questline. Gee, is everybody obsessed with jumping over burgers, donuts and long stone platforms that mimic the platforms seen on Speed Run 4 all of a sudden, what's next, jumping over-</p><p>Oh yeah, forgetful Kam! Who doesn't like ripping off their childhood games in their commercial masterpiece? Yeah, this game rips off Speed Run 4 during it's obby section, straight down to the yellow brick that gives you your superhuman speed. This is like what, 10 minutes in no less? I didn't know we were against the idea of adding Speed Run 4 when a miniscule ripoff of it already exists in my simulator type beat... God, fuck this game.</p><p>Plus the second quest is already a grind in itself. Pulling ten swords? Yeah, thanks for making the most insignificant part of the questline being the game title. God, fuck this game. And that's sure a lot coming from a group that calls themself xFrozen Obbies. Just go back to making shovelware obbies, simulator games do not fit your style.</p><h2>Pet Catchers (honorable mention)</h2><p>[Information provided by Nova]</p><p>This one will be short since we're almost done. There is this game, Pet Catchers. We didn't bother to play it properly because this was near the end of the The Games grind session. Plus, we got some flashbacks from The Hunt on my end, since I was reminded of Pet Sim 99 and another game that was pretty forgettable. I still forgot the name to that one.</p><p>We looked at this game last and went "yeah, that's enough of this for the day". It had three tasks (as expected of most of the copy paste garbage on this event), the top one? "Complete 3 soccer quests". I didn't know we were moving to a game of soccer, mother. There's also a quest for pet racing, one that says you just need to complete for. But complete can mean anything from playing a match to winning one. So do I win 3 matches or just play 3 matches? And another generic NPC quest on top of it.</p><p>There are worse games when it comes to this kind of thing, but we were so exhausted, we just gave up. It wasn't worth the effort. That was it.</p><p>Let's get to the meat.</p><h2>Super Golf</h2><p>[Information &amp; played by Nova]</p><p>This is one of those games where I had to get details through somebody else, so excuse exaggerations.</p><p>Holy shit, this game manages like a mess. The first quest of the entire GAME requires you to go to HOCKEY MODE to score 10 goals. HOCKEY MODE. IN A GAME ABOUT GOLF. Let your mind process that for just one minute. There is a supposed hockey mode in a game called "Super Golf". If that does not register as "what the fuck" in your brain, I don't know what you were thinking.<br></p><p>Not only that, but the game gives no clear indication of where this supposedly Hockey Mode exists, leaving the end user to just go looking for it on their own accord. Hello? The fuck? If you're going to introduce a user to a nonsensical part of the game, and force them to grind for a part of your game for a questline that does not revolve around you, at the very LEAST show the path. Various games already do this, and even sometimes auto-open the quest menu for you. There should be no reason why this game cannot do the same, holy shit.</p><p>On top of this, the first gamemode that was presented upon joining, is guess what: Basketball. That is now a count of TWO unrelated sports in a golf game, those being Hockey and Basketball. Now there is a server browser that lets you find servers currently hosting "hockey", which ends up just being golf with a hockey goal, but again, the game doesn't properly show you where this is.</p><p>And on top of that, not only does the game poorly guide the player and force them to grind a game, basically milking Premium Payouts, but the game also hides all three objectives until you finish them as you go. Meaning, if you're on the first objective, everything else is completely hidden. You have to work your way to the light overtime, possibly having the objectives ALSO change per player (not confirmed, so don't bank on it) and whatever other torture the developers can add on top of it as they wish.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially when you remember this is the millionth game to do this, this just a slow turbulance into madness. Speaking of madness!</p><h2>Obby But You're On A Bike / Bike Obby</h2><p>Just like the last time this game was featured in an event, this game is the worst part of the event, not by a lot, but it's up there in the top 5 of issues in my book.</p><p>Seriously, who the fuck let this game in twice? You're locked into doing "races" with people, being forced to complete stages that are FAR ahead what the average beginner will be at for any given game. Nobody wants to skip ahead to fucking, World 2 just to complete an event. Or race a bunch of assholes three times over. LET ALONE TOP 3. NO. FUCK NO.</p><p>Let alone trying to do Time Trials on this garbage. Who would want to stomach a full event world if you're left tasteless by the first five minutes? Do I look like I'm accepting this game to you? It still doesn't end there because they throw a bunch of fucking popups at you. "Your friend is online, invite them for a free bike!", fucking "Spin our wheel that's rigged and pre-determined so you can smash a table when you don't get it", hello??? Who approved this??</p><p>They get to count cash, you arrive on their doorstep and they do this to you for...</p><p>Completely free! They fuck you for completely free! For completely free, you can let the developers of this game fuck you over, no extra cost! It's mind boggling what kind of shit they put you through. It's a load of nothing but shi-</p><p><font size="1">For all viewer's security, Kam has been removed from the stage.

In a bittersweet, almost void-of-ideas move on the behalf of the corporation, they have rehashed the 1x1x1x1 bossfight from The Classic. If you ever felt this project from ROBLOX doesn't do enough to rehash ideas that nobody really asked for, or for disappointments to remind themselves of, ROBLOX has gladly given you the luxury to be disappointed by the lack of rewards once again.</p><p>Holy shit, this event is actually amazing. It keeps innovating in ways to upset the player and does nothing to show off the legacy of the platform, as it had the last event. On top of the bad selection, the lack of classic representation and the moderation team missing "Giant Feet" with a literal feet graphic for a team, they throw rehashed ideas and cashgrab titles your way.<br><br></p><p>What a horrible way to conclude this kind of event. Well, that was a fun grind, right? We fought through the gallows, pushed our way to the top, and we finally did the bare minimum. There is just one item left.</p><p>Or is there more to this?</p><p>A hidden part of this event is hidden in plain sight, but placed right on the table for the unlucky bastards that get to the top of the ranks. You'll very quickly find out that the last item is locked behind... Most Valuable Player status.</p><p>And the way to score this seems to be completely random. Maybe you need to complete more games than the rest of your team to get it, I don't know. It's massively unclear. So basically, if you join a massive team like Crimson Cats, the item is paywalled. "Yeah, have fun with your MVP status if you even get it at all, buddy. We don't want you around here."</p><p>Plus, who knows if these items will be taken from you at any time? They could take the wings from you if another player got above your status. What if that happens, what can you do except go on the grind again and defend your winged reward until another cuts your flying ability off from the stem?</p><p>After all, what's left for us at all?</p><h1>A Sour End</h1><p>Okay, I think I lost some brain cells writing this really passive aggressive blog. But at the least, we made it to the end as a team. Nova and I are exhausted. And personally?</p><p>Fuck this event with fingers up high.<br>The real warriors are the fighters are the bottom.</p>
