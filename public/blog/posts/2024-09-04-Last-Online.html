<h1>Introductions</h1><div>Requested by many people (specifically just <a href="https://spacehey.com/profile?id=2671764" target="_self">Sky</a> of all people) and as well as my mind, I have chosen to make a blog about the people who haven't been online in years. And why? Well, people who stopped showing up to some sites just intrigue me.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Plus I probably have some random person on Quotev asking the same thing when they see my old profile, so why not do it again?</div><h1>A World of New Technology...</h1><div>Yes, obligatory modern tech reference in oldschool internet blog. I'm sorry.</div><div><br></div><div>As with the rise of new technology, it is safe to say that it's possibly likely that dead accounts are still out there, in the form of new. As people get older and return to the internet years after fucking with it as teens, they probably make new accounts and work from scratch. So if you think really hard, there might be resurgences of old accounts. Maybe they're all hidden in plain sight.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean, what are the chances that you just scroll Reddit one day, or you scroll Tumblr or Bluesky or whatever the fuck you use, and you just see somebody and manage to connect that they were Butterflyjane94 a couple of years back?! Imagine what it would be like, actually finding out the fate of even one forever offline us-<br></div><h1>...The old still exists somewhere.</h1><div>Just kidding, Fuck you. We're going back here, this post isn't about miracles. Let's talk.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are like me, you probably have even a slight fascination of old internet. And if you have a fascination of old internet, then you are likely at places like iMood, Soulseek, Last FM, and sure... SpaceHey. Surely you would know about the fall of MySpace, or the early days of Facebook, the existance of limewire, and in some cases, last.fm's peak, sure. But the thing in common across all of these, and websites in general, is the fact that <b>we have ghost accounts on the internet.</b></div><div><br></div><div>What do I mean by Ghost accounts? The infamous phenomenon, "Last Online: 12 years ago". And that other type shit.</div><div><br></div><div>If you know a thing or two about abandoned accounts, you would know that it gives "Dead Internet Theory" a whole new meaning, depending on how you look at it. Those people can go for years without logging back on, and sometimes you'll never see them again. Obviously they are everywhere, to the classic Spacehey of course (specifically in 2-4 year ranges) to even as far back as the god damn ROBLOX brick game (up to 2007). Try putting that on your internet research table and chowing down.</div><div><br></div><div>Alright, enough goofing off. Let's get a little meta, a little worrying, and a little deeper. I have always wondered what things have looked like for these ghost accounts. That profile page says they were last online 12 years ago alright, but what would it look like if somebody tried logging into it now? Let's think for a moment.</div><div><br></div><div>Try to imagine what life might look like for xxJanitorFlies back in MySpace. It's 2006, you're logging onto your favorite social networking site. Forget the SpaceHey etiquette, forget the modern internet slang, forget the unholy brainrot. Think about what the internet life for that person might look like.</div><div><br></div><div>It's so hard to imagine, right? Like it makes you wonder what their messages looked like, or what they loved posting about so much! It's enough to get you to sit down and think what it would be like to talk to that person then. It's like, "okay I have their iMood profile, but why do they feel that way?". It's a wild enigma, especially when you all have to work with is a yellow smile and "happy" set as the mood. No extended mood, nothing. What do you think happened on that last day of logging on?</div><div><br></div><div>Not to mention the offline life. What do you think happened when they stopped logging on? Was their power cut? Did they just never turn back? Did they die??? All we have to work with is a timeframe, and a name. So you never know, maybe they stood spot five years ago where you're standing now! Who knows what kind of party starter they were!</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, we're getting a little excited. But that's what happens when you obsess over dusty pixels and shut down file sharing apps. I've been thinking about this topic for a few years now. so this is kind of natural. I think.</div><div><br></div><div>I have been on and off obsessed with ghost accounts, almost wondering what it would be like to peek head into Jane HQ. All you have to work with is so limited, so it's nothing but wondering what kind of fate they might have suffered. Or whatever kind of site they moved to, as well! I always wonder what the old internet was like, especially for piracy and social networking, so I can't help but also wonder where these people are now. if they're among us, and we just don't know they were somebody different that long ago.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Except maybe the MSN Messenger logs. You oldies can keep that to yourself.<br></div>
