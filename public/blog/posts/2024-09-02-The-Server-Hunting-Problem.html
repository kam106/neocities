<p>This is kind of a more personal rant of mine. While this rant is a little more heavier than usual, focusing a lot on chain reaction and overreactions, and a lot of other kinds of reactions... Obviously. But this rant is still a light hearted rant at it's core, despite how dramatic and overbearing it might be to some. I only want to goof off, after all.<br><br>But I genuinely have a love-hate relationship with searching for Minecraft Server ads on Reddit. So... Let's talk about it.</p><h1>Back to Stonewall</h1><div>For a brief moment, let's go back to the stone ages. The Stonewall of finding Minecraft Servers, if you will.</div><div><br></div><div>Long before the dawn of time... Before I was entirely aware of my actions, before I even knew what Myspace was... Before I got my annoying, booming personality. Back when the internet was more simple, ads were less extreme, and Google's power? Slightly less intense, when people didn't bat eyes as much.</div><div><br></div><div>Back then, servers used to be formatted in neat little lists, as far as I remember. Of course this is when I was young as shit, and didn't know where to find servers, so take my words with a grain of salt. There would be websites where people would flock to, you're given the server, you drop by, you have fun. That's that.</div><div><br></div><div>These server lists were cool, sure, but they were very primitive. Even now, they were made to fight for the top. Either you throw a bunch of money to get to the top or accept that most people won't click past the first page of the damn website. Yes, this is inevitable. If you don't believe me, count the times you ever had to use the second page of google on more than one hand.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, eventually those servers became garbage, people got bored of visiting the same types of servers, and well... Not many of them really focus on community. It's not like a nicely organized survival world where people can drop by and talk like people, right?<br><br>And that's where Hermitcraft comes in. With Reddit right behind it.</div><h1>Hope in the Castle<br></h1><div>I never actually watched Hermitcraft, so I can't actually say if it was good, if it was bad, or if it was... You know, literally anything or not. So I'll leave the comments to tell people about that.</div><div>Yes, I am aware of the existence of Lifesteal, and QSMP, I see you over there. But Hermitcraft is what influences a lot of Reddit based SMPs, so we're choosing to talk about that instead.</div><div><br></div><div>But as far as I can tell, it's like a co-operation heaven. There's shops run by diamonds, a whole welcoming community of friends that are all close, and best yet? Some trust among the people! It's a nice secluded place with a group of people who know eachother so well, trusting their own shops, making amazing buildings, and even making interesting conflicts in the world.<br><br>Okay, so what happens when a bunch of strangers you barely know make it?<br>You get the "Reddit Minecraft server community", a nickname I have given.</div><div><br></div><h1>An Orange Future</h1><div>And that's where the rant part comes in.</div><h2>Placebo for Desperates</h2><div>If you are unaware, Reddit has over the past four years gathered a mini community of subreddits dedicated to advertising Minecraft servers. If you are not already aware of some of them, some of these include r/MCServers for server ad postings, r/MinecraftServerFinder for both advertisers and users, and r/MinecraftBuddies for mainly users. We will be talking about MinecraftBuddies mainly as this is my subreddit of choice when it comes to searching.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, this is a rant. Sorry if you were mesermized by the retrospective from earlier, I was too, but we need to get angrier.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>For many people, what they're looking for in a Minecraft server changes. A lot. And it can be especially hard to explain what they're looking for when they forget the details every once and a while. And you especially get the frustration when people don't read.</div><div><br></div><div>Seriously, it's amazing.</div><div>Oh wait, we're not at that point yet. Let's rewind for a second.<br>Hey wait can we do it without the excessive header-<br></div><h2>Crafting the ad<br></h2><div>Okay, let's try this again.<br>While Reddit might seam like a wonderful tool for finding servers, you have to remember that you're basically advertising yourself to server owners. At least, that's what it's like where I'm from. So if you like the simple part of just having a new server fly on your face while you grab the ad and say "Oh my god, my calling has come to me!", you're wrong. Here's how it actually is.</div><div><br></div><div>First off you have to literally write out what you're looking for. In other words, basically crafting your own ads. Start with your age, because for one, who doesn't already share their age, and for two, because apparently some servers only allow people who are over 18 and over 16. Yes, those things exist. Because somebody in the Minecraft server community decided "Hey, this should be a meta!".</div><div><br></div><div>Now that you have your age and a basic intro paragraph (the part nobody cares about), you have to actually explain the shit you want. Be it a bunch of fighting people, some exploring, or even something basic. But don't get yourself too caught up, because this is where things kind of begin to fall apart.</div><div><br></div><div>You probably expected a simple game, didn't you? To finally easily find the server you want, and only the people who think they know you drop by, giving you servers you specify... You sure want that simple, vanilla server, with nothing but TPA, huh? Well fuck you, because you're getting Towny and Factions and you'll like it.</div><h2>The "MinecraftBuddies" Effect<br></h2><div>This is a strange trend I've noticed a lot with these kind of things. You list out in detail that you don't like factions because it's all about fighting and it's an RPG thing and you don't like the conflict it makes, then bam, come join our factions heavy server. This has happened nearly consistently in my own experience, and the fact that this happens basically almost EVERY time I'm searching for a server is fucking crazy.</div><div><br></div><div>You could be a mindless zombie, sure. You can stick to scrolling the server lists, but in the end, most of the things you see will just be ass and you won't like any of it. So instead of scrolling servers you usually don't like (at least in my case), you resort to letting people come to you and instead of getting better luck, people spit on you by ignoring half of your post.</div><div><br></div><div>Seriously, it does not take any effort to read I don't want FACTIONS of all things. What, am I being recommended Factions because I mentioned it once? Do people really miss the "I'm not looking for" part next to factions? Really?</div><div><br></div><div>Okay cool, so that part doesn't matter. So you write something dumb like "Only looking for Vanilla servers". Okay cool, you got your age, you got a short introduction, you got written what you're looking for. But uh oh, school's coming up soon and almost every teacher at your school will surely love giving you homework!</div><div><br></div><div>And then surprise, you'll have to do it all again, because little Timmy over there wants you to join his server, but then you have to be active 24/7 to stay. Yeah, real thing, wouldn't you love being active more than 3 hours for 5 days a week on Timmy's server like you're working a part time, right?</div><div><br></div><h2>More than Mildly Frustrating</h2><div>Didn't have enough yet? Let's talk about the underwelming. Assume your ad is done.<br></div><div><br></div><div>How about you start with the people who tell you basically nothing? They just leave a simple comment "DM me for more" and you find out it's over three paces opposite of what you actually wanted. This is even more frustrating than the people who just plainly disrespect what you're looking for because they hype you up just to kick you between the legs. Gee, thanks a lot for keeping my best interests in mind.</div><div><br></div><div>Not to mention the people who just tell you a bunch of shit about the server then tell you to add them yourself. Jesus, my discord tag is right there! You can read "@ kam106" on the fucking post, surely? Add me, don't just drop your tag and make me do it!</div><div><br></div><div>Plus to mention some of the time the other person has no fucking clue. Sometimes you have to notify them of the past three days as a reminder of why you're adding them and you have to end it off like "And then you left a comment on my post here:". Once I did all of that and the person literally had no clue what I was talking about. I had to hold in many urges to lash out at the dude to get his community together and get them to stop sending new members to you since they're making me doing shit like this just to have the guy go "iunno what you're on about", like is this a joke?</div><div><br></div><h2>The Fight for Satisfaction</h2><div>While we're at it, when you have such specific taste, it's nothing but a huge fight for even one good server, and the whole place is on fire. When people ask how your search is going, it's always like "My world's on fire! How about yours?" ah shit i made a smash mouth joke-</div><div><br></div><div>Forget about that! The search is always a pain in the ass. You specify you want Vanilla and people come to you with modded servers. You specify you want modded servers, and you get servers modded to hell and back. You specify you want light servers? Nope, not a market for it. And if you specify you want something normal to play for once, you hear royal sirens in the distance and a guy yelling "I HOPE YOU LIKE SEASONS!".</div><div><br></div><div>I am genuinely just appalled by ad searching. If you search, you mostly get junk you don't want. If you put out an ad saying you're looking, you mostly get junk you don't want. Everybody's trying to sell you on this whole grand server idea, and sometimes you even get the same person over five fucking times who doesn't fucking learn when you don't interact with their comment on the past three fucking posts you've made.</div><div><br></div><div>I might sound really angry about this, and that might be because I am, but I have to keep going because I've experienced most tricks under the sun by now and I must have gone through thousands of comments. Do you want to guess how many servers I actually enjoyed? Three.<br><br>The first server was modded and died out weeks after I joined.<br><br>The second server I barely play and I'm too nervous to interact with the community of.<br><br>The third server I had to quit because the buddy I was playing with got bored.</div><div><br></div><div>Literally everything in-between is filler. Mostly crazy people running amuck. I'm only in the second server now. The first server, I stopped talking to the guy. I also met another guy and I ended up having a few disagreements with him. Everything else either has too many people, isn't justifiable enough to play on, makes it very overbearing to try and interact with people, or I'm just too fucking nervous to try and interact with people. Why do you think I get nervous deciding if I accept people on SpaceHey?</div><div><br></div><div>I can blame this on being nervous all I want. You still have to hold accountable the fact that a lot of servers you try are just...</div><div><br></div><div>They're shit.</div><div>That's what it is.</div><div><br></div><div>Blog over.<br></div>
