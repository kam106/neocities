      <p>As we speak, I am currently stuck on a hotspot on a limited Data plan, only hooked up to lightly explore SpaceHey for updates. I am not browsing Neocities, I am not publishing any changes to my site, and I've been stuck like this since I moved into a new house my parents got their hands on.</p>
      <p>The place is pretty nice. It's cool and it's kind of nice. But that's not really what this post is about. Today, we're going to be talking about the experience of living off the grid, even if just a few days.</p>
      <h1>Six Days in Limbo</h1>
      <p>Okay, well it's not exactly a few days. It's actually just short of a week, from September 28th to October 3rd.</p>
      <h1>Down to Perfection</h1>
      <p>One of the ways I have been trying to mediate myself is trying to beat my own Ultrakill PBs. Sure, I always had the goal of getting good at Ultrakill, and trying to P rank the stages on every difficulty so casually, but having nothing better to do has helped me persue my very casual side goal of wanting to grind Ultrakill down to perfection.</p>
