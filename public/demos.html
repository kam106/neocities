      <h1>Music Demos</h1>
      <p><a href="https://kam106.neocities.org/">Back to Main Site</a></p>
<p>The WebAmp version of this page has been discontinued! Sorry.</p>
<p>If you are unaware, I make electronic/chiptune as a passion using the online music engine <a href="https://ultraabox.github.io/">Ultrabox</a>, a fork of Beepbox. What you're about to hear is a collection of demos I have decided to publically release, completely free. I plan to also add the stuff I already release on Tumblr, however that will take time.</p>

<b>Original Name: </b>intro
<br><b>Created:</b> September 17th 2023
<br><b>For: </b>As Far as the Eye
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>TBA
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>Maybe
<br><b>About:</b> Rough mix for the intro track for the album
<p>Sorry for not updating anything. This isn't quite the Tumblr demos, but hopefully this'll be good enough! As Far as the Eye was conceptualized earlier today, and tonight I finally starting producing songs for the album. So, this thing popped out.<br>
This isn't the first song that was made actually, this was the second. The first is a surprise that you might hear about VERY soon. But for now, lol, you're left to speculate. I made this song with no samples, which was actually because of some lack of plans. It's too early to tell if this song will make it or not, if it will be favored, but for now, here you go.</p><br><br>

<h3>Serenity</h3>

<b>Original Name: </b>N/A
<br><b>Created:</b> 09/05/2024
<br><b>For: </b>Sunset Avenue
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>Yes
<br><b>About:</b> Second officially released demo of Serenity
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): Wait a few months</b>
<p>With the ongoing project True To Me continuing to be in development, and with the new release of this blog, I have chosen to release an updated version of Serenity from my Tumblr page, right here to promote this blog as well as update the progress as show in the Tumblr version. Here you go, people. Progress I made.</p>
<p>Mixing is rough in the current state. Hopefully it is not complete shit, and it might just be listenable.</p><br><br>

<b>Original Name: </b>decay intro
<br><b>Created:</b> 09/04/2023
<br><b>For: </b>Now Entering Vezaa (september version of "Where Tyrants Fall")
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>Unsure
<br><b>About: </b> First version of "Enforced Transit", from before NEV was named
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>Enforced Transit was created as the introduction to the NEV project, which eventually became Where Tyrants Fall in 2024. It was just a simple project, and it started like this. I cannot remember if it made it to Where Tyrants Fall, or it's twin project The Cold Freeze Theory, but what I do know is the date of creation and some of the ongoing things in my life when this was made, which is not as important. Overall, Enforced Transit was just not used because I opted to work with different material.</p>
<p>Additional fun fact: NEV was made with Nova.</p><br><br>

<b>Original Name: </b>N/A
<br><b>Created:</b> September 2022
<br><b>For: </b>Luck is Gambling: You're Outnumbered
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
<br><b>About:</b> Unused throwaway from the late LIG: YO era.
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>I do not have the exact date of creation for this demo, but what I am very confident about is that this was made in 2022 for Luck is Gambling, and this song is relatively undocumented like a lot of the rare material I have. And as all early material goes, it's... Something.<br>
Say what you want about Nova being slow to release, but I have a lot of throwaways too, and sometimes those throwaways are not made to be for the final cut.</p><br><br>

<h3>LIGYO2</h3>

<b>Original Name: </b>N/A
<br><b>Created:</b> September 2022
<br><b>For: </b>Luck is Gambling: You're Outnumbered
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
<br><b>About:</b> Unreleased demo
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>The name is completely made up, because unlike Trance, there is no actual filename I can give this demo. Therefore, it's just LIGYO2, or if you're going off original filenames, "unmastered.mp3". This demo tries to be a production extraordinare for some reason, and I'll let you decide if that worked.<br>
Also, my bad for fucking up the bounce. I forgot to properly fix it when exporting.</p>
