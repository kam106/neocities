<br><b>About:</b> Second track made during NEV
<p>I've already shared the first of the only two tracks from the NEV sessions, here's the second! Final Destination is an earlier version of Leather Street, which was later named back to Final Destination. Unrelated to the movie of the same name, of course.<br>
This demo is pretty rough. It samples the work of Smaz9's <a href="https://smaz9.bandcamp.com/track/slow-burner">Slow Burner</a>, which is one of the songs that hugely inspired me to play with Beepbox as a whole more. This song is simple and pretty short, however it has potential. This thing is old as dirt so I'm releasing it. Go nuts!</p><br><br>

<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA
<br><b>About:</b> Companion track to The Face that Provides
<p>This track has an intro, but I decided to strip that out because it kind of ruins the current song state.<br>
MANIC was made before Face that Provides, and is the reason why FTP exists! The intro to this song is actually the outro of FTP, and when I was almost done one of the open verse demos, I decided that this song would make a good second track to go along with it's intro friend! How nice.</p><br><br>

<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>TBA
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>Maybe
<br><b>About:</b> Rough mix for the intro track for the album
<p>Sorry for not updating anything. This isn't quite the Tumblr demos, but hopefully this'll be good enough! As Far as the Eye was conceptualized earlier today, and tonight I finally starting producing songs for the album. So, this thing popped out.<br>
This isn't the first song that was made actually, this was the second. The first is a surprise that you might hear about VERY soon. But for now, lol, you're left to speculate. I made this song with no samples, which was actually because of some lack of plans. It's too early to tell if this song will make it or not, if it will be favored, but for now, here you go.</p><br><br>

<p>With the ongoing project True To Me continuing to be in development, and with the new release of this blog, I have chosen to release an updated version of Serenity from my Tumblr page, right here to promote this blog as well as update the progress as show in the Tumblr version. Here you go, people. Progress I made.</p>
<p>Mixing is rough in the current state. Hopefully it is not complete shit, and it might just be listenable.</p><br><br>

<b>Original Name: </b>decay intro
<br><b>Created:</b> 09/04/2023
<br><b>For: </b>Now Entering Vezaa (september version of "Where Tyrants Fall")
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>Unsure
<br><b>About: </b> First version of "Enforced Transit", from before NEV was named
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>Enforced Transit was created as the introduction to the NEV project, which eventually became Where Tyrants Fall in 2024. It was just a simple project, and it started like this. I cannot remember if it made it to Where Tyrants Fall, or it's twin project The Cold Freeze Theory, but what I do know is the date of creation and some of the ongoing things in my life when this was made, which is not as important. Overall, Enforced Transit was just not used because I opted to work with different material.</p>
<p>Additional fun fact: NEV was made with Nova.</p><br><br>

<br><b>For: </b>Luck is Gambling: You're Outnumbered
<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
<br><b>About:</b> Unused throwaway from the late LIG: YO era.
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>I do not have the exact date of creation for this demo, but what I am very confident about is that this was made in 2022 for Luck is Gambling, and this song is relatively undocumented like a lot of the rare material I have. And as all early material goes, it's... Something.<br>
Say what you want about Nova being slow to release, but I have a lot of throwaways too, and sometimes those throwaways are not made to be for the final cut.</p><br><br>

<br><b>Released Version Exists: </b>No
<br><b>About:</b> Unreleased demo
<br><b>Project Link (for remixing): </b>TBA</b>
<p>The name is completely made up, because unlike Trance, there is no actual filename I can give this demo. Therefore, it's just LIGYO2, or if you're going off original filenames, "unmastered.mp3". This demo tries to be a production extraordinare for some reason, and I'll let you decide if that worked.<br>
Also, my bad for fucking up the bounce. I forgot to properly fix it when exporting.</p>

<br><b>About:</b> Fourth released demo from Karma Whitney
<p>Quoted from the original Tumblr entry:<br><br>
    i've been pretty stressed out the last few days, and like i always do, i've chosen to make some music to let some of that stress out
and share it with tumblr for no reason, because that's what people do lmao<br>
this one a little short but hopefully its still really good, it uses some material from moonlight freestyle.</p>
    <p>i know this is short but as all songs do, it takes time to build them up into great works. moonlight freestyle is done and the version i featured here on tumblr was pretty basic compared to the finished version</p><br><br>
