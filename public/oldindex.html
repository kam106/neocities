  <h1>NOTICE</h1>
  <p>Add and message @kam106 on Discord if you can see this!</p>
  -->
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to another terrible plaintext site, because I have not yet figured out how HTML wizardy. Sorry if you came from another site, this page is mostly unfinished. You'll probably want to head over to the Music Demos section where things are more well kept.</p>
    <IMG src="https://i.imgur.com/0XGvlpg.gif"><br>
    <small>Tell me if you prefer this new plaintext or the old style at <a href="https://kam106.atabook.org/">my guestbook!</a></small>
    <p> <a href="https://neocities.org/site/kam106">Follow my site!</a></p>
    <h1>To-Do</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Actually make a layout</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Move navigation to the top</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Will need ideas</li>
            <li>Perhaps something like the old site</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Add a blog</li>
          <ul>
            <li>RSS maybe?</li>
            <li>Port SpaceHey entries (preferrably with original dates saved)</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Backport some things from my OG site?</li>
        <li>Find a spot for current site buttons (direct copy paste the code from spacehey, if allowed)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make it scroll left to right slowly with all the buttons I have</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Maybe lean less towards plaintext again (will need input from friends and some help with code building)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Add Tumblr released music demos</li>
    <li>Replace audio tags on Music Demos with <a href="https://codepen.io/sadness97/pen/RwKbNWW">a WebAmp instance</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Needs <a href="https://dokode.moe/blogs/howto-winamp">a theme added!</a> Aiming for WinAmp5.</li>
        <li>Will need a page reformat</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Add a list of interests and recent games</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Likely will base it on <a href="https://amstillgrowing.neocities.org/interests">Anne's (@amstillgrowing)</a> with some changes so it feels like a unique page</li>
        <li>Include hobbies & projects in place of books?</li>
      </ul>
    <li>A unique dark background to differentiate from other blogs?<li>
    </ul>

<h2>Web Note Stuff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To-Do is a developer thing but let's let users view the roadmap anyway lol</li>
  <li>More dented list added, based on code snippets from <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/html-guide/lesson-4">The Cave of Dragonflies, HTML Lesson 4</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- Originally put a dragonflycave table here, removed in newest edit 
but for reason neocities cached my site and it's stuck on the site... if you're reading this then my site finally got fixed.
and you're a nerd. lol. -->
