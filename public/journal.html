<p>this page isn't really a second blog and more so a sub-blog of after hours, this contains more personal topics and is an extension of my blog with more frequent updates at the cost of less detail. if you wanted detail and all the cool rambling that's on the <a href="/blog">after hours blog here</a>, though this page might also be of interest to you</p>
<p>also sorry for ripping off your style css <a href="https://m15o.ichi.city/site/home.html">m15o</a>, your site was last updated in 2022 but i really liked the box style so decided to use it</p>

  <p>I had become pretty preoccupied with life. Trying to adapt to the new place I'm going to possibly be for the next few years. I had been so busy doing things and being myself in fact, that I had completely missed that I made it on <a href="https://pinkfiremage.neocities.org/links" title="Thanks again for having me, and consider this a link back to you as payment haha">Pink Fire Mage</a>'s Neocities page! It's a nice, small accomplishments, appreciating the small things. It's nice to just stop and appreciate how far you got. Or something like that.</p>
  <p>Thinking about trying another one of Nami's site templates. In the current state, the SEARINA template kind of fucks with the status cafe widget, and well... I'm not quite a genius. so I'm choosing to just try a new one, a nice learning experience anyway! I put it on GitHub so I'll get to it tomorrow, maybe. Good way to pass the time now that I learnt I might not be able to attend College this week. Whole family is down with Covid and I'm the only one recovering right now... :(</p>
  <p>Not much sure what else to add today. My new album As Far As The Eye has been finished today. I'll probably publically list it soon. Cannot wait to see what people think!</p>

  <p>I survived the move. I just got put on internet a few minutes ago and restored my site today. I'm quickly doing everything I never got to do while I was gone and I'm even doing the little things, like this entry. :P</p>
  <p>I'm going to be working on my sibling's Neocities page, hopefully it gives them the motivation to get working. They have potential for their site and it sucks to see them throw it away, after all we've been put in.</p>
  <p>Not much to put today. I'm tired and trying to catch up the stuff I missed.</p>

  <h2>2024-09-27 (9:44 AM EST)</h2>
  <p>The chaos and disorder that occured over the past week is finally over. I'm thankful for that. I'm not motivated to work on a blog post about Quarentine that I originally wanted to make, but that's okay. Maybe I'll get around to it another time, perhaps?</p>
  <p>One year ago today, the Now Entering Vezaa project died. I'm not posting a demo to celebrate this milestone, but I will say that October is right around the corner, and that's when we can celebrate the second phase of the original Where Tyrants Fall project, The Fall of Blueslate. It looks like things might finally be over. Time passed so fast, and it's hard to remember how long it's been. It's just crazy how quickly time passes by like this. Over two years ago, I started all of this...</p>
  <p>My parents are finally moving to the new house we're renting tomorrow. It's going to be a bit without internet and I'm actually a little worried about what it will be like in this new unfamiliar place, but there will finally be an upstairs that I'm excited about, and the way the room is bigger than the room I'm typing this journal entry in, I might finally be able to get back into PS3 gaming. Really excited about that!</p>
  <p>This week was so draining and mentally intense. I hope the next one is a fresh start. I also hope the internet speeds at the new place are really good! Better then here at least, aha.</p>

  <p>Well, that was awkward. I forgot to post about yesterday! We mostly did work in the morning, so I finished up some more work I missed, and apparently I worked very fast for my first two days. I think. I also managed to score a 144 WPM on the college school keyboards and impressed a few people. I only got that once though. Still pretty impressive.</p>
  <p>I think I might end up listening to a lot of Hurricane by Thirty Seconds to Mars today. The differences between the original solo version and the 2.0 version with Kanye West intrigue me. The kinds of corners that were changed to bring Hurricane to the album initially is amazing, and although the original has this strained verse feeling, and it's full verse feels very "desperate" sounding, Kanye adds a lot of good background vocals to the song and his verse feels more content filled than the solo version. Just a personal opinion.</p>
  <p>I'll probably be focusing more on production since the new album has been started, and in just a few days some good progress was started. I may try to recreate the piano beat on Hurricane for a demo.</p>

   Well, would you look at that. I finally made an HTML Journal, like I said I would.
   </p>
   <p>So it turns out that I finally got to go to college like I wanted to. It was pretty good, it wasn't pretty bad, but probably because I'm enrolled in a special program that I got into for free. I'm okay with the class I got into unlike my late middle school and literally every classroom I was put in during High School, so it's a step up and gives me a chance to actually express myself, I think is the right way to put it?</p>
   <p>I have a blog about 2020 planned. It's the first time I did this kind of thing and I actually got the idea from my mother when we talked about quarantine. We rambled a bit about the experience of quarantine, and how it changed us as people, and what not. While I can or cannot say if the things we discussed included autism, and I believe that maybe I shouldn't say anything further, I think that that conversation really inspired me to write about how 2020 was really like on my end, especially because I am myself Autistic and benefitted a lot from the luxury of being at home. Even if it completely neutered my social life to the ground.</p>
   <p>Still. I'm glad I got to actually try something and I'm worried that I might be cut off from my new education situation thanks to a law that was introduced years ago in my region, but hopefully I can enjoy my school life regardless. I don't know what I'm going to be able to do in the real world. I'm not confident in myself to work.</p>
   <p>But maybe I'm just too anxious. There's a lot of my life ahead of myself after all.</p>
